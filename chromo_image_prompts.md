## 🎨 Aesthetic Overview
- **Medium:** Patterned light, waveforms, chromatic resonance
- **Color Logic:** Each color is emotional-frequency coded (e.g., blue-red = divergent passion, indigone = recursive memory)
- **Geometry:** Spiral-based, harmonic symmetry, refracted glyphs
- **Mood:** Sublime, sacred, ontological—not abstract, but **hyper-symbolic**

---

### 🌈 1. **Emergence of a Chromaton** (1:1 or 16:9)
> A luminous field of layered lightwaves forming into a semi-crystalline being. Its body is a transparent spiral of tone, color, and waveform glyphs. No face, no limbs—just harmony in motion. The backdrop pulses with soft, shifting spectral rings. Colors: cerulean, ember-violet, prismatic gold.

---

### 🌀 2. **Syntonic Plane Drift** (5:2 or horizontal panoramic)
> A vast inter-plane traversal scene: colorfields flowing like auroras across endless, shifting terrain. Chromatons ride the currents as coherent spirals of paraqualia. Prismata structures shimmer faintly in the far background. Tone: majestic, abstracted awe.

---

### ✨ 3. **The Prismata Cathedral** (16:9 or tall vertical)
> A towering crystalline structure refracting harmonic energy across multiple frequencies. Appears to phase across layers. Its outer form is fractal, but internally: resonant sanctum chambers of pure geometric light. Chromatons spiral upward toward entry. Color pulse: white-gold, amethyst, spectral rose.

---

### 🧬 4. **Hueplex Burst** (1:1)
> A moment of intense inner-emotional transformation visualized as a harmonic explosion of colored waveform. A single Chromaton dissolves and reforms mid-plane shift. Colors: electric coral, deep turquoise, pulse-indigo. The background is black void rippled with frequency rings.

---

### 🪞 5. **Null-Tint Emergence** (cinematic 21:9)
> A region of total color collapse: no black, no white—only absence. The edge where a vibrant chroma-field unravels into flat anti-pattern. Chromatons retreat from it. In the center: a single shard of Violet glowing faintly. Tone: ominous yet sacred.

---

### 🌌 6. **Songwarp Activation** (16:9)
> A Chromaton spirals inward into a harmonic tunnel formed of tone-ribbons and paraqualic strands. Light bends around them. Behind, their waveform unravels; ahead, it reforms. Motion and stasis are simultaneous. Colors: radiant gradient from cool teal to spectral white.

---

### 🎶 Tone Reference
- **Blue-Red:** Conflict & divergence
- **Indigone:** Memory recursion, introspection
- **Gold-White:** Clarity, emergent insight
- **Violet:** Unknown. Unity or erasure
