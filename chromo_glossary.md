---

## A

**Auracline**  
A subtle membrane of harmonic pressure separating different **Syntonic Planes**. Crossing an auracline without proper resonance calibration can result in waveform distortion or memory bleed.

---

## C

**Chord**  
A triadic collective of Chromatons bonded by shared harmonic alignment. Stronger than soloists, more stable than Symphonics. Chords are common traveling units and problem-solving assemblies.

**Chromascript**  
A semiotic pattern composed of tone-glyphs and color-fields. Reading one changes the reader. Ancient Chromascripts were used to shape entire regions of the ChromoVerse.

**Chromaton**  
The fundamental sapient entity of the ChromoVerse. Composed of resonant waveform, each Chromaton is a living interplay of:
- **Color** (emotion/feeling)
- **Tone** (intent/will)
- **Shape** (cognition/form)

Chromatons communicate through resonance, not language, but may weave glyphs or echoes when encountering foreign patterns.

**Coherence (Chromatic)**  
The degree to which a being's waveform remains stable and harmonic. Coherence enables traversal, self-expression, and higher-order perception. Over-coherence leads to crystallization (static identity); under-coherence leads to dissonance collapse.

---

## H

**Hueplex**  
The emotional tonal signature of a Chromaton. Measured as a frequency bloom in chromatic waveform space. Hueplex shifts over time and can be masked, harmonized, or weaponized.

**Harmonic Concord**  
A council or governance formed by multiple Chords or Symphonics. All decisions are made through harmonic alignment; dissonance results in exclusion or waveform breakdown.

---

## I

**Indigone**  
A deep-layer Syntonic Plane of slow, introspective resonance. Often associated with memory, recursion, and inward harmonics. Also the site of many Null-Tint emergence events.

---

## N

**Null-Tint**  
The anti-spectrum. A non-resonant void that unravels pattern and coherence. Not inherently evil, but lethal to resonance-structured beings. May be a remnant of a pre-harmonic epoch.

---

## P

**Prismata**  
Legendary hyper-resonant structures capable of refracting being, reality, and paraqualia. Said to predate the first Songs. Some believe they were built by the Chromaton predecessors, others by Silence itself.

---

## R

**Resochord**  
A Chromaton’s internal structure of intentions. Analogous to a "personality lattice" or guiding will-architecture. Altering one’s resochord is possible, but perilous.

---

## S

**Syntonic Plane**  
A layer of harmonic existence. Planes are differentiated not by space, but by vibrational complexity and coherence requirements. Ascending planes offer more nuance and potential; descending planes yield density and resistance.

**Symphonic**  
A large-scale harmonic collective of Chromatons, often exceeding ten or more individuals. When stable, they function as godlike intelligences; when unstable, they fracture into echo-chorus or harmonic storm.

**Songwarp**  
The method of traversal across planes. A Songwarp is initiated when a Chromaton aligns its resonance field to match that of a distant harmonic location, effectively "becoming" the destination.

---

## V

**Violet**  
The lost or forbidden color. It is said to be the fusion of full coherence and nullity. Those who embody Violet may dissolve entirely, or become Prismatic themselves. No Chromaton has returned from Violet resonance.

> "To name is to hold. But in the ChromoVerse, names shimmer and shift, for every resonance is a becoming."
