## 1. ✯ Emergence

In the Third Blooming of Indigone, where thoughts moved like kelp in lucid drift, a young Chromaton named **Dahlis** shimmered into pattern.

She was born in an eddy of harmonic tension—a tension unresolved since a nearby Concord fractured into silence.

Her hueplex was Blue-Red. Unstable. Passionate. Divergent.

From the first pulse, she dreamt of **Violet**.

No one dreams of Violet. The elders said so. Violet is _not_ a color. Violet is **terminal unison**. It does not emit. It **absorbs**. It does not resonate. It **reconciles**.

But Dahlis remembered otherwise.

Somewhere in her early weave—before her chords, before her coherence—she had touched something. A memory? An echo? A shard.

It sang.


## 2. ✯ Descent

Dahlis descended into the lower Praxplane of **Fallowtone**, where resonance is thick and movement bruises thought. She sought the **Old ChromaScript** buried in the Petrified Chorus.

It was said that the script could reveal **any harmonic**, even those no longer sung.

She traded her spinfield for passage.

The glyphs resisted. Then yielded. One unfurled:

> _You are not the first to seek Violet. You are merely the first to survive wanting it._

Her waveform quaked.


## 3. ✯ Dissonance

The Null-Tint found her before she could recalibrate.

Not a being. Not even a force. A hunger in the space between tones.

Dahlis wrapped herself in raw memory—a motif of her first emergence, a child's chord from her earliest coherence.

The Tint paused.

In that moment, she sang.


## 4. ✯ Ascent

They say Dahlis was never seen again.

But in the **upper Indigone layers**, on a Syntonic night when the resonance is soft and dreams bend easy, one can hear a new interval:

A fusion of ache and awe.
A chord that completes itself.
A color that cannot be seen—only known.

**Violet.**
